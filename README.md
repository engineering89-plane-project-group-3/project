# Plane Project

## Scope 
Given a set of user stories we must complete a program satisfying all the necessary requirements. 

**User Stories**
- As an assistant I want to be able to create passengers with a name and passport number, so that I can add them to
  a flight.
- As an airport assistant, I want to be able to create flight_trip with a specific destination
- As an airport Assistant, I want to be able to assign and/or change a plane to my flight_trip, input my password,
  so I can handle the problem.
- As an airport assistant, I want to be able to add passengers to flight_trip, so that I can sell the tickets to them.
- As an airport assistant, I want to be able to generate a flight_attendees_list_report list of passengers names 
  and passports, so that I can check their identity documents

## Entity Relationship Diagram
An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) helped us illustrate the logical structure of our databases by defining their
attributes and showing their relationships. 

## Class Diagram 
A class diagram was created to further demonstrate and  map out the structure of the system by modelling its classes, 
attributes, methods and the relationship between objects.
